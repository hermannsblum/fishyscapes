  <div class="message-body">
    We are working on a new submission system that will go online in early February 2023. To concentrate on getting it online soon, we currently do not accept new submissions in the old system.
    To prepare a submission, expect to upload a <a href="https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.10/user-guide/build_a_container.html">singularity image</a> that will mount a folder `/input` and should process all images to produce both segmentation and anomaly scores (as npy files) in `/output`.
